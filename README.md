# Escape the Desert - Game User Guide
## 🧭 Background
*Set on Highway 50, Nevada – “The Loneliest Road in America”*

Highway 50 cuts through the heart of Nevada like a scar. It is desolate, sunbaked, and eerily silent. Once a vibrant route for pioneers and dreams, it’s now a forgotten stretch swallowed by sand and stories of those who never made it out.

You are a lone explorer on a top-secret mission gone wrong. What was meant to be a quick recon trip across the arid wastelands of the desert has turned into a fight for survival. Your Range Rover is low on fuel, and the only road out stretches endlessly through dunes, ruins, and danger.

Now, stranded on a stretch of road that never seems to end, you’re in a race for survival. Tumbleweed litters your path, turning every second into a life-or-death decision.

Your mission? **Escape.**  
Your ally? **Your reflexes.**  
Your only rule? **Don’t stop.**

Navigate the road, dodge hazards, and outrun whatever curse lurks behind the horizon. The second you falter, so much as your wheels brush a tumbleweed, it’s over. The desert wins.

But you’re not ready to give up. Not yet.

How far can you go before the desert claims you?
